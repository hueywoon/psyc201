# About This Website {.unnumbered}

This is the R companion website for Prof. William Tov's PSYC201 class. 

_Note._ Students who have taken PSYC208 under Prof. Huey Woon Lee would already have seen parts of this in the [PSYC208 R companion website](https://hueywoon.github.io/assignment). If so, then you may skip the getting started and basics sections. :)
